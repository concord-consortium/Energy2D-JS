h1. Energy2D-JS

http://concord-consortium.github.com/energy2d-js/model2d-demo.html

Energy2D-JS is a JavaScript port of the Java application: "Energy2D":http://energy.concord.org/energy2d/index.html

This JavaScript port supports simulation of thermal conductivity and convection in a 100x100 cell simulation space. 

If the browser supports "JavaScript Typed Arrays":https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript_typed_arrays 
Energy2D-JS will use use them for increased computational performance.

h2. Getting a browser that supports JavaScript Typed Arrays

"JavaScript Typed Arrays":https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript_typed_arrays are available in browsers that are WebGL-enabled. On some browsers using JavaScript Typed Arrays will speed up the modeling part of the simulation by a factor of two. Get more information about whether your browser supports WebGL here: "http://get.webgl.org/":http://get.webgl.org/.
